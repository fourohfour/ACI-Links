# ACI-Links
This is a project to track all available episodes of Air Crash Investigation (Also known as Mayday) that are available to watch online on sites such as YouTube or DailyMotion.

Each Season is contained within a markdown file, named accordingly. Each episode is also shown within this file, in the format:

    X - EPISODE NAME

Where X is the Episode Number.
Below each Episode Heading is a list of links, each one to a different mirror for the episode. YouTube links should be in the shortened form accessed in the 'Share' Tab below the video name. DailyMotion Links should be formed of just the video's unique identifier. For Example:

    http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtg8u8_mayday-s01e05-flying-blind-aeroperu-flight-603_shortfilms

Can be shortened to:

    http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtg8u8

Links to any other video sites should be kept to the most terse form possible - however link shorteners should not be used.

720p or 1080p videos can be marked with the [HD] tag and should be put above the SD links for ease of access.
